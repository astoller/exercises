I am from a little town 30 minutes south of Boston called Sharon. I attended Sharon High School, one of the best public schools in the state of Massachusetts. I found the website above, which lists the top public schools in the state. If you click on the name of the high school a new page comes up with more information about the school and the town. The initial list is easy to follow and the page is not cluttered with information. Rather, one can obtain more information about a school of interest if he or she wants. I think it would be interesting to compile information on the top 20 public schools in the state. I would make columns in an excel document for the school, ranking, town, grades, how many students attend the school, math and reading proficiency and graduation rate. I would also include the student diversity distribution based on race and gender. Many of the top schools are not very diverse. Sharon itself is 70 percent white. Diversity in a school system provides varied perspectives and out-of-class learning opportunities. In structuring this information, one could compare the schools ranking with how diverse it is. Could having a more diverse student body improve the school system? Schools constantly strive for diversity for a reason, yet the top schools often lack what they preach.
